First and foremost, I wanted to give a massive round of kudos to Queen ZZLOC, The Voice, taking home Song of the Year for her smash hit single, Although, Enjoyment from the Barbie soundtrack. I personally just think she looked like an absolute star last night. The hair, the outfit, everything about it is exemplary, and I loved her performance. It made me very emotional. However, I must say my favorite part of the night was seeing both Miley and Hannah take home their respective trophies. As I'm sure you've heard many a times throughout the years, these two ladies did not get along on the set of their shared sitcom. They even got into a fistfight once, allegedly. However, these days, it seems the two of them have put it all behind them and more than buried the hatchet. In fact, during Miley's acceptance speech, you could even see Hannah giving her a standing ovation. It's just heartwarming to see these women finally supporting each other after all these years. And the night came even more full circle when we got to see Daniela Monet take home the Grammy Award for Best New Artist for her hit musical, Chicago. Funny enough, Daniela Monet was actually in the running to play Miley's character on Hannah Montana way back in 2005. It's wonderful. It seems everybody's gotten the best of both worlds. But on a serious note, y'all did sizzle real fucking dirty. This was some bullshit. She won Best R&B Album. I'm sorry, I don't even listen to sizzle like that, but you can't sit here and tell me that album wasn't a whole fucking moment. Like that didn't ship the world the way it did. I'm sorry, did Taylor Swift need another album of the year? Did Billie Eilish need another song of the year? Were they gonna die without it? Be fucking real.", "@belatown_video_7259174781101313326.mp3": "So quite a few people have requested that I make a video detailing the lore of Bailetown, or like the connections between all the different characters. So that's what I'm going to be doing today. So for starters, these are the two main characters, Kendra and Gary. Kendra and Gary actually first dated in high school. They were together for a couple of years. That is until Sarah came into the picture and she made up a rumor that Kendra was cheating on Gary so that she could steal Gary away from Kendra. Once Kendra was out of the picture, Sarah snatches Gary up. She cuts a hole in the condom. She gets pregnant. They get married. Their first child is this here, Melody. Melody, she's got quite a mouth on her. And then they had a second child, Anna Lynn, a couple years later. But this is not biologically Gary's child. And he did not find out about that until a couple years into her life. He still sees her as his daughter, though, and takes care of her accordingly. Eventually, Gary finds out that Sarah has been cheating on him with his brother, Frankie. Now, Frankie and Gary have a very tumultuous relationship. Gary's kind of like a father figure to Frankie. That's how they were when they were younger because their father left at a very young age. However, Frankie has some animosity that he holds towards Gary because of the fact that the reason why their dad left in the first place is because Gary told their mom that the dad was cheating and thereby Frankie kind of blames Gary. So even though Gary's like really good to Frankie and has helped him a lot, Frankie has that kind of resentment towards him that made it okay for him in his mind to sleep with Gary's wife. So after that, Gary and Sarah obviously got a divorce. And that's when he reconnected with Kendra because he found out through his therapist that she works at the McDonald's near him. And, you know, they're now hashing that out. Kendra just recently got out of relationship with Kevin here. He was cheating on her with her ex best friend, Ariel. I think you're familiar with her. Ariel is actually a lesbian, but she's very resentful of the fact that she's a lesbian because she was raised very conservative and Christian. She married Eric. Eric is trans. She doesn't know that Eric is trans though. Eric at some point ended up leaving Ariel for the new Ariel. And now these two are really at each other's throats because they both are in love with him. She's not really in love with him, but like she has a connection to him. It's complicated. Another man that Ariel has involved herself with romantically to distract herself from her homosexuality is Derek here. But Derek is in a long-term relationship with Elsa. He doesn't really love Ariel. Ariel insists that she's in love with him, but she's really not. It appears I'm also going to have to make a part two that should be up right now.", "@taylorswift_video_7273459734785559851.mp3": "This has been the most extraordinary experience of my entire life.

Drea, you don't have to tell him right now. Maybe I don't have to, but I want to. I had sex with Brandon. What? You slept with my fianc\u00e9, Brandon? You're my own cousin. How could you do this to me? Oh, you're gonna try and talk down to me now? You sure weren't preaching to that choir when you decided to sleep with your brother's wife. How the fuck could you do this to me? Because, like a wise woman once said, there's nothing I do better than revenge. I know all about what you did with my ex-boyfriend. You mean Henry? Yeah, that's right. You slept with him, and I knew you slept with him. So I decided I would pipe your girl before I ever introduced her to you. And just as I planned, you fell in love with her. You had sex with Drea before you ever introduced her to me? Yup! And I had fun doing it! For what it's worth, Frankie, I never cheated on you. My relationship with him ended before we started dating, so don't even try to play victim right now. It's nowhere close to what you did to me. It doesn't matter, Drea. You still lied to me. No, I didn't. You never asked me if I slept with him because I never figured that you had. Were you expecting me to guess that you were sleeping with my best friend while we were engaged? Babe, look. If you can look past what I did to you, I can look past what you did to me. Absolutely not, Frankie. What's done is done. This wedding is over, and so are we. Really? You're just gonna throw it all away like that? Yes, I am! Because it's not much to me anymore. You burnt up every last shred of respect I had for you, Frankie. We're over. Brandon, look. At this point, you're all I have. Wait, what? Are you not mad at me? You're all I have. Gary, he doesn't want anything to do with me anymore. My mom, she doesn't even call me. She was all I had left. Brandon, what do I do? I'm losing you. I don't have a home. I have nothing. Why am I such a terrible person? I don't know what I did. What did I do to deserve to be this kind of person? Wait, Frankie. Really, Melody? Are you happy with yourself? I am happy with myself. Because I exposed you for the type of fucking ranted bitch you are, Sarah. Have a good night.

He's cheated on her with 20 women and five men. He is also fighting that demon of bisexuality. He insists he's not, but he is. Now, here's where things get a little bit tricky to understand, and I need you to bear with me here. So this is Elsa. This is Ho Elsa. Now, these are two separate people. However, at one point in time, they were the same person. At one point, it was just this Elsa. And this was like up until the end of high school. Mind you, all these people are between the ages of like 28 to 32, but they all went to high school together. A lot of their drama that insists upon all of them originated there. Elsa was deeply, madly in love with her high school boyfriend, and that's when Melissa came into the picture and slept with her boyfriend, and she was so betrayed and so heartbroken that all of the evil inside of her divested and diverted into Ho Elsa. And now Ho Elsa runs around the town just sleeping with everybody's man. However, there is sort of a good side to Ho Elsa. Ho Elsa's promiscuity actually exists less to target the women that she's sleeping with the husbands and boyfriends of, and more to target them. Ho Elsa will purposefully seek out men she suspects of being potential cheaters, offer them sexual advances, and then put herself in a situation where she's going to be caught sleeping with him by the woman. It's kind of like if you've ever seen Dragon Ball Z, where the Namekian Kami like diverts all of the evil inside of him into becoming King Piccolo. However, King Piccolo eventually like becomes a good guy. That's basically Ho Elsa. Her methods are imperfect, but really all she wants is for these women to want better for themselves. Derek has two children. One of them is with Elsa, but it's not biological. It's an adopted child. As Jojo, she's not really that relevant, honestly. She shows up from time to time. He also has Naya, and now this is a little girl that he had with his ex-girlfriend, Sheena. Sheena ended up leaving Derek after he slept with her father, and then she found Greg, and this is her new man. He's a real stand-up guy. They have a child together, Sierra. Sierra and Naya are really close, and Greg takes care of both of them equally. He loves Naya as if that's his own daughter. Another thing worth noting is that Greg and Gary are really good friends. They met as children when they were in 4-H together. The inseparable bond. They haven't been in an episode together yet, but if they are in one, they're very close. And now we have just a few more characters who are kind of out of this loop. Kelsey and Travis. They are a little bit younger than the rest of these guys. Kelsey is 24. Travis is 25. Kelsey and Travis started dating in high school. However, there was a bump in the road when Travis was being groomed by their teacher, Mrs. Hanson. Her name is just Shannon if she's not in the environment of being a teacher. Shannon essentially forced Travis to kind of sleep with her in order to get decent grades. He was a super senior in high school at the time, so he was 19. That's why she defends herself, but it was still really weird of her to do that. Now, Kelsey and Travis were able to make it through this, and they are still together for all intents and purposes. However, even though she's forgiven him, he really hasn't forgiven himself. He still has a lot of shame and guilt. He's taken up a really chronic substance abuse issue. This has not only really negatively affected their relationship, but as well as his relationship with his son, Zeke. Zeke is just a really innocent, wholesome little guy who's been thrust into this really bad situation. Now, Sharon is married to Sonic. However, they both cheat on each other quite a bit. It causes a lot of turmoil in their relationship. They've tried being in an open relationship, but they're both just too jealous. It's very likely they are on the fast track to a divorce. And finally, here we have Leona. She was born into a lot of money. She really doesn't have to work a regular job a day in her life to get by, but because of that, she does a lot of community service. You'll see her helping at the soup kitchen. She works at the rehabilitation center. She sometimes works as like a cop, but the cops in Baylor Town aren't really cops. They're more like social workers. She also works with Child Protective Services. She also is a transgender woman, and because of that, she really likes to use her resources to help out the LGBTQ plus community in Baylor Town. Just overall, a really charitable woman. But yeah, those are the people, and that's the connections between them. I have a lot more characters I still haven't used, and you'll learn their stories later, but that's just what this is for now.", "@kyaboyko_video_7287340941881494790.mp3": "And now I want to sit back and relax and enjoy my evening when all of a sudden I hear this agitating, grating voice.", "@thatrecipe.us_video_7284045695156243754.mp3": "With three potatoes and some meat, I can make a delicious dinner.

I got some bad news, got some good news. Good news is I get to pull the clutch with my daughter. The bad news is there's some bad eggs. The bad news, again, is she'd probably like to tear my head off. So let's do this. So, I actually get to cheat. OK, OK, oh man. This is a big girl, and she's not nice. Her head pops out, let me know. OK, so we'll move that over. There we go. Oh, I never had that happen, and I almost, my hand, pulled my own hand off from the rail. You got it? Oh yeah. Luckily I had it on my side. You notice what I said, it's a good thing my daughter's helping me. I'm like done. Rolling our dinosaur over. OK, so check this out. Oh yeah, she's really cool. Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop. Yep, uh-huh. Get ready, guys. She's going to do the whole thing. I'll take it from here. OK, here we go. OK. OK, so the good news is, even though she wants me, man, this is going to be difficult. She's literally waiting for me to get in the exact position that she thinks she can reach. And I borrowed Tim's hook, which is too short for me. But what do I know? What do I know? Now, did you notice, I took my guard down for one second, and she took advantage of that one second. When I said this is a grumpy snake, I ain't kidding. She's actually positioning herself, hiding her body over there, so she can get further than it looks. Oh man, I don't get nervous, but this time I'm a little bit nervous. They ask me all the time, oh, are you ever scared? I always say no, but this time I'm thinking I'm just too tired and slow. OK, come on, girl. OK, come on. OK, there you go. You stay over there and bite the cameraman. OK, so having these is all not that. Whoa, dang. Whoa, told you I felt like I was off my game a little bit. Juliet, why don't you throw yourself in front of it and stop it? Dang, that was so close. Let me wipe its saliva off my face. This clutch is exactly why we take the eggs. They're half bad, half good. Almost 100% chance they'll get maggots, rot, and all the eggs will die. So I think there's only going to need one box today, because there's so many infertile eggs. No, we can't go on that side, because she'll bite us. No, not that side. Go ahead. Go ahead, yeah. The other side. And of course, because these are snake eggs, they have to all be up the same way. Look at that big girl. Hopefully we have enough eggs to get lucky. Oh, man, there's a lot of infertiles, way more than we expected. Whoa. Yep. I need a snake hook. Aisle three. Where did mine go? Where did you dump all the snake hooks? There we go. There we go. There we go. We got them all. So we are successful. Juliet, you've got some quick hands. Now the question is, how do I get grumpy? I know how to get grumpy. Where's that hook? So all I've got to do is I'm going to basically touch her, so she wants to come over and light me up. And when she lights me up, she'll come over on this side. So she's going to work to try to hide body. She'll see her head will stay there, her head will stay there, but she'll get closer and closer with her body so she has more distance of striking. So right now, she's thinking, you know, if I was crazy and I like making videos, I'd take risks. I'm crazy maybe, but I don't want to take risks. So otherwise, I'd show you by, whoa, I'd show you, I would show you what I'm talking about. Now, you're probably thinking right about now, wow, why is he antagonizing her? So here's the deal. I could just grab her by the neck, yank her out, stress her whole life out. Or I can let her just argue with me for a few minutes. And when the argument's over, she'll be like, OK, it's cool. And then she probably won't bite me, probably. But the point is, I won't be strangling her, fighting with her, and making it all crazy. I'm trying to get her to burn her angry energy. And I say angry, it's just protective energy. Unfortunately, with this snake, it's more than protective energy. She's kind of not the nicest snake in the whole world. Do you want to cover those eggs? Yeah. Matter of fact, let's put them in the incubator, and I'm going to deal with this in one second. Because at the end of the day, I don't want her to knock her own eggs over because we're trying to save her eggs and her babies. How many we got in there? I didn't even count them. You guys ready? Guessing? Here we go. 27. 27. What did I say a minute ago? Anyway, we got 27 good. Whoa! I looked at the, as soon as my eyes shift off of her, see how smart this snake is? The second I shifted my eyes off, she knew that I wasn't ready to jump. Almost smoked me. I mean, that is incredible. So that was crazy. You guys just saw one of the closest strikes I've had in a long time. Go to the other side and hold the box. But not, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa! Yep, this one's a little grumpy. This one's spirited, like my children. We like to say passionate. Well, I would not want anything but kids that do have to stand for their own. Come on. And this is one of my kids that's standing for its own right now. It just doesn't realize that dad's right, that I just saved all their babies. OK, just take that off the other side. OK. So, whoop, this is where it gets a little interesting. Oh, come on. Let me tell you, if I didn't have a little bit of skill handling big snakes right now, this would be a whole other video. Whoa! Here, I got a snake hook. There you go. I didn't actually. Come on, girl. Come on. Come on, close your mouth. Close your mouth. Enclosure's right there. Come on. Enclosure's right there, girl. There you go. We'll get her settled down. She'll be back to normal, and we're going to keep living the dream. That was an easy one. That was really a rough one, but I knew it would be. Luckily, she isn't scared enough, unfortunately. Sometimes I'm worried she's going to get bit. Hope you had a great time. And if you haven't met Juliet, there she is. Here I am, honey. Have an awesome day.", "@daniellecohn_video_7295525771836149034.mp3": "Hi guys! I want to show you how I make my lasagna. So I just went ahead and washed these sweet peppers and also got all the seeds out and now I'm just chopping them into small pieces. I'm also going to chop this white onion and I also finished chopping up all of my peppers so just put those to the side. Also I'm only doing half of this onion and my eyes are already watering. I'm literally crying from this onion right now. My eyes are still watering. Okay so once we have all of our veggies now we're gonna go and chop up some garlic. If your store has these get them because I just love them. They make such a difference because it's not like the already minced one it's like garlic cloves peeled. Okay so you can do as many as you want. I usually do like four or five. Don't mind Glacier. Don't know why she's meowing. Chop that up and then we'll start cooking. Okay so my garlic is chopped. I like to leave kind of like some big chunks of it in there. Just me. But if you like garlic it's it's good. Okay so I'm gonna go ahead and pour in some olive oil. Saute my garlic and veggies and then add in the meat. I like to let the garlic kind of cook a little bit then add in the other veggies. Start sizzling like that. You can go ahead and add your veggies. Saute that for a little. Add your meat. So I'm, here's how it looks by the way, I'm using ground beef and ground Italian sweet sausage but you can do really whatever you want. Just saute that around until it looks pretty cooked through. Okay so once you add in your meats you can go ahead and start seasoning them. I like to season them with a couple different things. I like to use adobo and then I'm also going to use a couple more. I'll show you them. Also I'm gonna do some Tony's Creole. Now I'm gonna do some pepper. I'm also going to be adding in oregano and Italian seasoning. So we're gonna do some of those. My eyes are still watering from those onions. Next up I'm just gonna do like a tad bit of paprika, not too much just like a little bit just for the meat to have flavor and then I'm also going to do some garlic salt. I'm not gonna do garlic powder just because I already put a lot of fresh garlic in there but I am gonna do a little bit of garlic salt. So I'm just gonna let the meat cook down with the veggies and then once it's fully cooked I'm gonna add in the sauce and let it simmer for like 10 minutes and then we can start making the lasagna. So I don't add salt just because a lot of the seasonings I use already have a lot of salt in them so it just makes it too salty if you add extra salt. This is the pasta sauce I'm gonna use this one I like it a lot it's good. You can also drain the oil from your meat but I suggest leaving a little bit of it just because it does add flavor. Just letting that all cook down. Okay so I'm gonna go ahead and add my sauce into it just like that. Then I'm gonna go ahead and mix that all up and then let it simmer on low for like 10 minutes just so it can all kind of get all the flavors together nicely. Okay so while that's still cooking I'm gonna start getting the lasagna ready to go in the oven. It's already preheated to 350. I use the oven ready one because it's just so much easier. Also anytime I cook lasagna I use one of these just because it's just way easier. So just lay them down and then add your ricotta and it's easier too if you have a flat noodle. Okay so I just put a few like spoonfuls of ricotta and I'm just smoothing that out onto it. It doesn't have to be pretty because it's just all gonna go together at the end. So once you have like a good layer of the ricotta you can add your sauce on and some like shaved cheese. Also here's what the sauce is looking like. So I'm just gonna take a spoon and start adding this all over. I don't know why I said shaved I meant shredded but then you can just go ahead and add on your shredded cheese. I'm using this aged Italian blend. I like freshly shredded cheese better but it's just so much extra work so I need to get a like one that shreds it for me. And just keep repeating that. I usually do like three layers. It really just depends what you want. Okay so once you've done all of your layers you can go ahead and do the top and I put a lot of cheese on the top because it looks pretty and I love cheese so it'll taste good too. Okay so once you're done with everything you can just, well you don't have to do this, but I like to add some oregano to the top of it and then I put it in the oven for 45 minutes with tin foil and then you take it off and put it in for 15 minutes uncovered. So this is the before and I'll show you guys when it comes out. Okay and this is how it looks after when I just took it out of the oven. And yeah let it sit for like 20-30 minutes and eat it!", "@k00k134_video_7328649663492427050.mp3": "Nicki Minaj is essentially the Dr. Seuss of her time, and what I mean when I say that is she's objectively a disgusting and reprehensible person by pretty much all metrics of basic humanity and common decency, yet her one singular talent that appears to be an innate ability to rhyme words together in a silly fashion that particularly resonates with children has cemented her with a legacy she really does not deserve as much as many female rappers who came before her. In case you're not already up to date, the self-proclaimed queen of rape has spent the past 24 hours deflecting from the fact that her husband is a convicted sexual predator who is not allowed near public parks or elementary schools by making fun of Megan Thee Stallion for getting shot as well as referring to her as Bigfoot. It's always amusing to me how Nicki Minaj immediately jumps to making fun of other people's appearances as if she didn't spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2008 getting illegal Craigslist butt injections from some guy in his basement, and not just that, she lied about it for 10 years and only confessed after her ass cheeks were visibly deflating in public and everybody could already tell. And listen, I'm not at all reveling in the fact that she's a terrible person I was a very big Nicki Minaj fan growing up. Ask anybody who went to middle school with me, I loved her so much. I would defend her to anybody who would listen. I saw her doing that And I was like, huh, finally some real music. However, around 2018 when she started intentionally surrounding herself with sex offenders I kind of fell off the wagon She was announcing her associations with them faster than she was dropping new music And it's always especially humorous to me when I see Nicki Minaj as well as her fans attempt to defend her by saying you only Attack the men she associates with for being sexual predators because you don't have anything on her I beg to differ Barb's because not only are we talking about a woman who once gave a lap dance to a 13 year old boy We're talking about a woman who once made a song with a then 16 year old little twist in which she says these lyrics in conclusion.
